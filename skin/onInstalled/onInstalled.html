    <h1>Thanks for Installing "GitHub Contributions"!</h1>

    <p>
    <b>TL;DR:</b> Update the extension's <a href="#" class="chromeOptLink">
        options</a>; they're set to do nothing by default. GitHub
    contributions are cool.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the Extension</h2>

    <p>
        This extension modifies GitHub's profile contribution view.
    </p>

    <p>
        It can calculate (1) total yearly contributions, (2) longest
        <em>yearly</em> commit streak, and (3) the current commit streak.
        <br>
        Similar to GitHub's 'classic' display.
    </p>

    <p>
        It can also completely remove the contribution display - if you're
        not into that sort of thing.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three main view modes:
        <ul>
            <li><i>Modern</i> - displays the information in the header bar
                above the contribution calendar</li>
            <li><i>Classic</i> - displays the information below the
                contribution calendar in large boxes</li>
            <li><i>Disable</i> - removes the contribution display outright</li>
            <li>(<i>Do Nothing</i> - the extension doesn't modify the page.
                Essentially same as turning off the extension)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Each mode has additional options - allowing you to pick and choose
        which values are displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Be sure to select your preferences!</b> (Nothing is selected by
        default.)
        <br>
        You can change these under <a href="#" class="chromeOptLink">options</a>
        in your Chrome Extensions tab (chrome://extensions).
        <br>
        Or by clicking the browser bar icon.
    </p>

    <h2>About GitHub's contribution changes</h2>

    <p>
        GitHub announced profile contribution changes in this
        <a href="https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile">
            blog post</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this update GitHub removed code streaks (among other things).
        Leaving the contribution calendar to focus "on the work you're doing
        rather than the duration of your activity."
    </p>

    <p>
        Some users believe contribution statistics can be harmful. For example
        this <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/627">post</a>.
        <br>
        Others enjoy streaks and the 'classic' view.
    </p>

    <p>
        This extension is intended simply to give you an easy way to customize
        GitHub's contribution view.
        <br>
        It holds no intention to conflict with "contribution philosophies."
        GitHub's or otherwise.
