# GitHub Contributions

## About the Extension

A Chrome extension to customize GitHub's contribution view.

It can calculate (1) total yearly contributions, (2) longest *yearly* commit
streak, and (3) the current commit streak.
<br>
Similar to GitHub's 'classic' display.

It can also completely remove the contribution display - if you're not into
that sort of thing.

There are three main view modes:

* *Modern* - displays the information in the header bar above the contribution
* *Classic* - displays the information below the contribution calendar in
              large boxes
* *Disable* - removes the contribution display outright
* (*Do nothing* - the extension doesn't modify the page. Essentially the same
                  as turning off the extension)

Each mode has additional options - allowing you to pick and choose which
values are displayed.

**Be sure to select your preferences!** (Nothing is selected by default.)
<br>
You can change these under options in your Chrome extensions tab
(chrome://extensions).
<br>
Or by clicking the browser bar icon.

## About GitHub's contribution changes

GitHub announced profile contribution changes in this
[blog post](https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile).

In this update GitHub removed commit streaks (among other things). Leaving
the contribution calendar to focus "on the work you're doing rather than the
duration of your activity."

Some users believe contribution statistics can be harmful. For example this
[post](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/627)
<br>
Others enjoy streaks and the 'classic' view.

This extension is intended simply to give you an easy way to customize GitHub's
contribution view.
<br>
It holds no intention to conflict with "contribution philosophies." GitHub's
or otherwise.
