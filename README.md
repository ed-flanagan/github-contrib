# GitHub Contribution Streak

A simple Chrome extension to display a user's longest contribution streak
for the past year.

This extension just iterates through your contribution calender. So it is
unable to detect streaks beyond a year from the current date.

GitHub removed code streaks (see this
[blog post](https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile))
and I figured some people would miss the functionality.

## Chrome Store

You can install the extension through the Chrome Web Store:
